## Technologies Used
made with pygame
![required](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pygame)

## Problems
after pressing button 'Play' 'cross figure' will be placed in the place where it was at the time the button was pressed. This is due to my implementation of the button click check and how fps works in pygame.

## How to play
download all files from ttt_game folder and put them in one folder. After that you just need to compile tic-tac-toe.py
